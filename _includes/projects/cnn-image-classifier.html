  The FashionMNIST dataset consists of images representing various clothing types. To process this dataset, I first loaded the data, ensuring that each image was represented as an array of pixel values.

  To reduce computational complexity, I applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to lower the dimensionality of the image data while retaining key features.
  This optimization significantly improved efficiency in model training.

  Using the processed dataset, I designed and trained a <strong>Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)</strong> to classify images into their respective clothing categories.
  After 20 epochs of training, the model achieved an <strong>90% accuracy</strong> in correctly identifying clothing classes.
