  This project was composed of two primary components: data engineering and machine learning modeling.
</p>

<h3 class="card-header">Data Engineering</h3>
<p class="card-text">
  I designed and implemented an end-to-end data pipeline to collect publicly available apartment listings through web scraping.
  Automated bots were developed to extract and parse HTML content for listings within a target city, with the resulting data stored in structured JSON files.
  To support scalable and reliable analysis, I designed an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) and implemented a SQLite3 relational database.
  Data integrity and schema consistency were enforced using Pydantic validation, ensuring high-quality inputs for downstream modeling.

<h3 class="card-header">Machine Learning Modeling &amp; Analysis</h3>
<p class="card-text">
  The second phase focused on exploratory analysis and predictive modeling.
  Through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), I identified key trends as well as common challenges associated with noisy, real-world housing data.
  I then developed and evaluated three predictive models:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>XGBoost</strong> (Extreme Gradient Boosted Trees)</li>
  <li><strong>Feedforward Neural Network</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Lasso Regression</strong></li>
</ul>

<p class="card-text">
  Due to the limited availability of structured numerical features from HTML listings, I enhanced model performance by incorporating text-based information.
  Amenity descriptions were transformed into numerical features using <strong>TF-IDF (Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency)</strong>.
  This feature engineering strategy resulted in a <strong>55% reduction</strong> in average squared error, substantially improving predictive accuracy.
