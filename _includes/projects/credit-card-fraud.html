  I trained and evaluated several classification models—including Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forests, and Logistic Regression—to identify fraudulent credit card transactions among European cardholders.
  To improve predictive performance and robustness, these models were combined using ensemble learning techniques.

  While each individual model performed well, a soft-voting ensemble achieved the strongest results, reaching an overall
  98% classification accuracy in fraud detection based on 14 anonymized input features.

  It is important to note that the dataset contains highly informative features, and performance of this magnitude may not generalize to noisier, real-world environments.
  Nevertheless, this project provided hands-on experience with ensemble methods and model evaluation, offering practical insight into techniques commonly used in applied fraud detection systems.
