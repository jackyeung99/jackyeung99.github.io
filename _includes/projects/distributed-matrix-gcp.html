  As machine learning workloads continue to grow in scale and complexity, efficient computation has become increasingly critical.
  In the Engineering Cloud Computing course, I was tasked with leveraging Google’s MapReduce architecture to distribute computational workloads across multiple virtual machines.

<h3 class="card-header">Project Overview</h3>
<p class="card-text">
  To study the performance benefits of distributed computing, I identified and replicated a research paper evaluating alternative matrix multiplication schemes.
  This required designing an orchestration framework capable of partitioning large matrices into smaller submatrices and coordinating their execution efficiently.
</p>

<h3 class="card-header">Implementation on Google Cloud Platform</h3>
<p class="card-text">
  Each matrix was decomposed into appropriately sized chunks, with pairs of submatrices dispatched to
  <strong>Google Cloud Platform (GCP)</strong> serverless functions for parallel computation.
  The partial results were then aggregated to reconstruct the final matrix.
  This approach demonstrated the scalability of serverless architectures for large-scale numerical workloads and achieved an average <strong>8× speedup</strong> compared to standard matrix multiplication on GCP.
