  This paper presents a generalization of the efficient iterative update originally developed by Mark Newman for the
  Bradley-Terry (BT) model, extending it from pairwise comparisons to
  multi-entity interactions under the Plackett-Luce framework.
  The Bradley-Terry model, which is closely related to the Elo rating system used in chess, provides a probabilistic approach for estimating
  latent player or entity strength.

<h3 class="h3 mt-3">Two-Entity vs. Multi-Entity Interactions</h3>
<p>
  Two-entity interactions involve head-to-head comparisons between two players, teams, or items, such as
  <em>soccer matches</em> or <em>boxing bouts</em>.
  In contrast, multi-entity interactions arise in settings where outcomes involve more than two participants, including
  <em>Formula One races</em>, <em>ranked-choice competitions</em>, and <em>tournament-style events</em>.

<h3 class="h3 mt-3">Extending the Bradley-Terry Model</h3>
<p>
  To support higher-order interactions, the framework leverages hypergraphs, which generalize traditional graphs by allowing edges to connect multiple entities.
  The likelihood function is reformulated accordingly, enabling the efficient iterative structure of the Bradley-Terry model to be preserved under multi-body settings.
  This extension allows for faster and more scalable estimation of entity strength in complex competitive environments.

<p>
  The proposed method was evaluated using both real-world preference data and synthetically generated datasets, providing a comprehensive assessment of its performance and robustness.
