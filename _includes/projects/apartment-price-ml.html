  This project consisted of two major components: data engineering and machine learning modeling.
</p>

<h3 class="h3 mt-3">Data Engineering</h3>
<p>
  I built a data pipeline to retrieve publicly available apartment listings using web scraping.
  I developed bots to scrape HTML content for listings in a given city, parsing the extracted data and storing it as a JSON file.
  To structure the data effectively, I designed an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) and implemented a SQLite3 relational database,
  ensuring robust data integrity through Pydantic for validation.
  This approach was necessary to ensure accurate predictions at scale.

<h3 class="h3 mt-3">Machine Learning Modeling &amp; Analysis</h3>
<p>
  The second phase of the project focused on analyzing the data and developing predictive models.
  Through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), I identified trends and challenges in real-world data quality.
  I then built three machine learning models:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>XGBoost</strong> (Extreme Gradient Boosted Trees)</li>
  <li><strong>Standard Neural Network</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Lasso Regression</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>
  Given the limited numerical data available from HTML content, I sought to enhance model accuracy by incorporating text-based features.
  I processed amenity descriptions using <strong>TF-IDF (Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency)</strong> to transform text into numerical representations.
  This feature engineering approach led to a <strong>55% reduction</strong> in the average squared error, significantly improving predictive performance.
